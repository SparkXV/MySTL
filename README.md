# STL-Implementation

Implementation of various STL containers in C++

##### Vector
```
Version2: Used templates to make easier to work with different data types.
```
##### Stack
```
version1:
Time complexity:
     push()=O(N)
     pop()= O(1)
Space Complexity: O(N)
```
##### Queue
```
version1:Implemented using Array
Time complexity:
     push()=O(1)
     pop()= O(N)
Space Complexity: O(N)

version2:Using two stacks
```
